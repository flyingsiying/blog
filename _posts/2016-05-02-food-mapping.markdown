The objectives of this project are to:
1. Develop a detailed spatial understanding of the food environment;
2. Compare food environments of diverse populations living in different areas and comprised of different sociodemographic characteristics;
3. Provide community partners and policymakers with reliable, representative data pertaining to food access, food patterns and behaviors, health conditions related to diet, food security, and neighborhood characteristics.
